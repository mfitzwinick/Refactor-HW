# Refactor-HW

The objective of this project was to review the code provided, and update it with semantic html elements.  The page included various segments that needed to be changed from plain divs to more descriptive semantic html.  A style sheet was provided, but a new style sheet was required to link the new semantic code appropriately.

# How to Access the Work

I will be supplying a url to the project along with a git hub url.

# Things needed to view

The index.html is a file that is linked to both a style sheet (asssets/css/style.css) and an images folder.  All three files are needed.

# Challenges and Observations

This assignment allowed me to better understand how the index.html file works in conjunction with the style.css file.  Finding the proper semantic terms was a bit tricky, and I'm not sure I chose the correct terms.  I focused on the divs, and tried to make them more descriptive.  There are some things that I am still confused about. For example, I read that using "span" isn't semantic, but I wasn't able to figure out a better solution for the header.  Also, I didn't understand why an id was placed in two of the sections, but not in the first.   My biggest challenge was making sure that the sections/divs were opened and closed properly.  I also had to play with the style sheet to make it match up.  Over all, it was a good exercise, and I hope that I was able to use the correct vernacular.  I was very happy when my page finally looked like the original!
